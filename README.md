Hi,
I'm an avid cool stuff enthusiast, electronics hobbyist, science enjoyer, amateur radio operator, and open source appreciator. I mostly do electronics projects with high voltage, radio, power, microcontrollers, sensors, or some combination of those things, but I also code in Python and I do some embedded programming for various microcontrollers. 

My profile image is an inductively coupled plasma ring in a neon globe driven by a class E power oscillator.
